Hello, I'm Ingrid!

Ingrid is a lightweight CSS layout system, who's main goal is to reduce the use of classes on individual units.

Ingrid is a bit less obtrusive and bit more fun to reflow for responsive layouts.

Ingrid is heavily inspired by oocss grids (oocss.org).

Ingrid is also meant to be an extensible system, easy to customize to your own needs.

So, The basic idea…

+-------------------[c]-------------------+
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ ¦
¦ |       | |       | |       | |       | ¦
¦ |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |  [u]  | ¦
¦ |       | |       | |       | |       | ¦
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ ¦
+-----------------------------------------+

The container [c] needs two classes:

  1) .ingrid
  2) .in-fourths (or .in-thirds if there are 3 units).
  
Each unit [u] within the container [u] needs the class:

  1) .unit
  
-------------------------------------------

To tweak the layout we can combine units

+-------------------[c]-------------------+
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-----------------+ ¦
¦ |       | |       | |                 | ¦
¦ |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |       [u]       | ¦
¦ |       | |       | |                 | ¦
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-----------------+ ¦
+-----------------------------------------+

In this case the container [c] has the same classes
as in the first example.

The difference we add the class .span-2 on the last unit.

-------------------------------------------

Units that need to span the whole width of the
container use the class .field-unit [f].

+-------------------[c]-------------------+
¦ +-------------------------------------+ ¦
¦ |                 [f]                 | ¦
¦ +-------------------------------------+ ¦
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ ¦
¦ |       | |       | |       | |       | ¦
¦ |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |  [u]  | ¦
¦ |       | |       | |       | |       | ¦
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ ¦
+-----------------------------------------+

Gutters

The gutters are made by first giving the container [c]
negative left and right margins. 

Each unit [u] needs a padding on each side that is equal to
the containers negative margins.

The gutters are preset to a certain width in ingrid.css. 
But can be easily overridden and tweaked to your own preference 
via classes that extend the ingrid container or directly 
in ingrid.css.

The padding are set directly on each unit thanks to 
the border-box box model (sorry IE6-7 ).
