Hello, I'm Ingrid!

Ingrid is a fluid CSS layout system, who's main goal is to reduce the use of classes on individual units.

Ingrid is a bit less obtrusive and bit more fun to reflow for responsive layouts.

Ingrid is heavily inspired by oocss grids (oocss.org).

Ingrid is also meant to be an extendable system, easy to customize to your own needs.

Ingrid loves cats :o)

So, The basic idea…

+-------------------[c]-------------------+
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ ¦
¦ |       | |       | |       | |       | ¦
¦ |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |  [u]  | ¦
¦ |       | |       | |       | |       | ¦
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ ¦
+-----------------------------------------+

The container [c] needs two classes:

  1) .ingrid
  2) .in-fourths (or .in-thirds if there are 3 units).
  
Each unit [u] within the container [u] needs the class:

  1) .unit
  
___________________________________________


To tweak the layout we can combine units

+-------------------[c]-------------------+
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-----------------+ ¦
¦ |       | |       | |                 | ¦
¦ |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |       [u]       | ¦
¦ |       | |       | |                 | ¦
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-----------------+ ¦
+-----------------------------------------+

In this case the container [c] and units [u] have 
the same classes as in the first example.

The difference is that we add the class .span-2 
on the last unit (making it span the width of 
two units).

The span-x class can be used in any context 
to combine units

___________________________________________


Units [f] that need to span the whole width of the
container use the class .field-unit.

+-------------------[c]-------------------+
¦ +-------------------------------------+ ¦
¦ |                 [f]                 | ¦
¦ +-------------------------------------+ ¦
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ ¦
¦ |       | |       | |       | |       | ¦
¦ |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |  [u]  | |  [u]  | ¦
¦ |       | |       | |       | |       | ¦
¦ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ ¦
+-----------------------------------------+

Gutters

The gutters are made by first giving the container [c]
negative left and right margins. 

Each unit [u] has a padding on each side that is equal to
the containers [c] negative margins.

The gutters are set to a certain width in ingrid.css. 
But these measures can easily be overridden/tweaked to your 
own preference via your own classes that extend the container 
or directly in the ingrid css-file.

The paddings are/can be set directly on each unit thanks to 
the border-box box model. And last but not least, the widths for 
the paddings (again, thanks to border-box) work with em, % or 
pixel units.

Compability 

Ingrid works just fine with IE8 + and all modern browsers.
IE6-7 might need some extra help for not supporting border-box model.
