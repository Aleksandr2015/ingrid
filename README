Hello, I'm Ingrid!

Ingrid is a lightweight CSS layout system, who's main goal is to reduce the use of classes on individual units.

Ingrid is a bit less obtrusive and bit more fun to reflow for responsive layouts.

Ingrid is heavily inspired by oocss grids (oocss.org).

Ingrid is also meant to be an extensible system, easy to customize to your own needs.

Ingrid loves cats.
